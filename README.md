# Legends of Z

Taking place in the middle ages, Legends of Z is a action RPG about a small fox, Zack, out to collect powerful crystals before Arch Hunt uses them to take over the world. The game mechanics are based on [Make an Action RPG in Godot 3.2](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLruHL7t3QhB9nQJsNVmnJ5WyuJrMaRE65) and currently uses it's assets as a placeholder.

## Inspiration

As the name implies, the game is inspired by Legends of Zelda, and is based on an concept by Tup (Travisuped) back in 2005, an old friend of mine. He put together a quick Visual Novel-style flash that I've included in this repo, located under ``/archives``. You can play it by going to [Ruffle](https://ruffle.rs/)'s demo page.
