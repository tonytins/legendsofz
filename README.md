# Legends of Z

Taking place in the middle ages, Legends of Z is a action RPG about a small fox, Zack, out to collect powerful crystals before Arch Hunt uses them to take over the world. As the name implies, the game is inspired by Legends of Zelda, and based on an idea by an old friend back in 2005. The actual game itself is based on [Make an Action RPG in Godot 3.2](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLruHL7t3QhB9nQJsNVmnJ5WyuJrMaRE65) and currently uses it's assets as a placeholder.
